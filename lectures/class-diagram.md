## What is a UML Class Diagram?

A UML (Unified Modeling Language) diagram is a standard visual way to express the design of object-oriented software.

A **class diagram** specifically shows:
* The program's classes
* Their attributes (fields) and operations (methods)
* The relationships between the classes 

---

## The Class Box üì¶

A class is represented by a rectangle with three compartments stacked vertically.

| Compartment | Content | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Top** | The name of the class. | `CreditCard` |
| **Middle**| The attributes (instance variables). | `customer: String` |
| **Bottom**| The operations (methods). | `charge(price: double)` |

---

## Member Syntax and Visibility

Each attribute and method has its visibility marked on the left. 

**Visibility Symbols**
* `+`  **public**
* `#`  **protected**
* `-`  **private**

**Type Syntax** 
* **Attributes:** `visibility name: type`
    * Example: `- limit: int`
* **Methods:** `visibility name(parameter: type): returnType`
    * Example: `+ charge(price: double): boolean`

<div style="margin:auto;position:absolute;right:10%;top:15%">

```plantuml

@startuml
skinparam classAttributeIconSize 0

class CreditCard {
  - customer: String
  - bank: String
  - account: String
  - limit: int
  # balance: double
  --
  + getCustomer(): String
  + getBank(): String
  + getAccount(): String
  + getLimit(): int
  + getBalance(): double
  + charge(price: double): boolean
  + makePayment(amount: double)
}
@enduml
```
</div>

---

## Showing Relationships: Inheritance

To show relationships like inheritance, you use arrows.

  * **Inheritance** is represented by a **hollow arrow** pointing from the **subclass** to the **superclass**. 
  * This is an **"is-a"** relationship. It connects a subclass to its superclass.

**Notation:** A solid line with a **hollow, triangular arrowhead** pointing from the subclass to the superclass.


```plantuml
@startuml
skinparam classAttributeIconSize 0

class CreditCard {
  # balance: double
  + charge(price: double): boolean
}

class PredatoryCreditCard extends CreditCard {
  - apr: double
  --
  + charge(price: double): boolean
  + processMonth()
}
@enduml
```

*`PredatoryCreditCard` is a subclass of `CreditCard`.*



---

## Interface Implementation (Realization)

This is an **"implements"** relationship. It connects a class to an interface it provides an implementation for.

**Notation:** A dashed line with a **hollow, triangular arrowhead** pointing from the implementing class to the interface. Interface names are typically marked with `<<interface>>`.

```plantuml
@startuml
skinparam classAttributeIconSize 0

interface Sellable <<interface>>
interface Transportable <<interface>>

' BoxedItem implements both interfaces
class BoxedItem implements Sellable, Transportable {
  - descript: String
  - price: int
}

'BoxedItem .u.|> Sellable
'BoxedItem .u.|> Transportable
@enduml
```

---

## Association (Composition)

This is a **"has-a"** or **"part-of"** relationship, where an object of one class is composed of, or contains, an object of another.

**Notation:** A solid line with a **filled diamond** on the side of the containing class (the "whole").

This is used for the **Composition Design Pattern** mentioned in the text. For example, a `LinkedStack` contains a `SinglyLinkedList` to manage its data.

```plantuml
@startuml
skinparam classAttributeIconSize 0

class SinglyLinkedList { }

' The filled diamond shows LinkedStack "has-a" SinglyLinkedList
' The "1" indicates that one LinkedStack contains exactly one list
class LinkedStack {
  - list: SinglyLinkedList
  + push(e)
  + pop()
}

LinkedStack *-- "1" SinglyLinkedList
@enduml
```

## Summary of Relationships

| Relationship | Meaning | Arrow Style | Line Style |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Inheritance** | "is-a" | Hollow Triangle | Solid |
| **Implementation**| "implements" | Hollow Triangle | Dashed |
| **Composition** | "has-a" / "part-of" | Filled Diamond | Solid |



Here is a diagram that combines all the relationship types we've discussed.

:: right ::

<Transform :scale="0.85">

*   **Inheritance:** `Car` is a type of `Vehicle`.
*   **Implementation:** `Car` implements the `Drivable` interface.
*   **Composition:** `Car` has an `Engine` (represented by the `engine` attribute).



```plantuml 
@startuml
skinparam classAttributeIconSize 0

' Interface for behavior
interface Drivable <<interface>> {
  + drive()
}

' A component class
class Engine {
  - horsepower: int
  + start()
}

' A general base class
class Vehicle {
  # speed: double
}

' A concrete class showing all relationships
' 1. Extends Vehicle (Inheritance)
' 2. Implements Drivable (Implementation)
' 3. Has an Engine (Composition)
class Car extends Vehicle implements Drivable {
  - model: String
  - engine: Engine
  + drive()
}

' Composition: A Car "has-a" Engine.
Car *-- "1" Engine
