// Tree Terminology Definitions based on the provided graph:

// Root: The node with no incoming edges.
//  - A is the root node.

// Internal Nodes: Nodes that have at least one child.
//  - A, B, C, F are internal nodes.

// External Nodes (Leaves): Nodes that have no children.
//  - D, E, G, H, I, J, K are external nodes.

// Ancestors: The nodes on the path from the root to a specific node (excluding the node itself).
//  - Ancestors of K are F, B, A.
//  - Ancestors of H are C, A.

// Descendants: The nodes in the subtree rooted at a specific node (excluding the node itself).
//  - Descendants of B are E, F, I, J, K.
//  - Descendants of C are G, H.

// Depth of a Node: The number of edges on the path from the root to that node.
//  - Depth of A: 0
//  - Depth of B, C, D: 1
//  - Depth of E, F, G, H: 2
//  - Depth of I, J, K: 3

// Height of the Tree: The number of edges on the longest path from the root to a leaf.
//  - The height of this tree is 3 (e.g., path A -> B -> F -> K).
